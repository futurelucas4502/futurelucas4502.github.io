# futurelucas4502.github.io - Documentation:

Welcome this is a little project I made mostly for myself but the idea is that anyone can fork this and use it on their own github pages or jekyll site (may need extra config for jekyll).

## Setup:

1. Fork the repo
2. Go into the setting and change the name to your-username.github.io
3. Open the setup.js file in assets/js/ and go through the comments in the file to change the 8 variables needed
4. Save and commit your changes to setup.js and your done! (Yes its as easy as that)

**Note**: It may take up to 20 minutes for the site to appear live after dollowing these steps.

## Further customisation:

If you want to host your site at somewhere other than your-username.github.io you can go into the repo settings and set this just make sure you change the site_url in the setup.js file!
