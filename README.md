## About:
This is a completely dynamic single page website which can be forked and used by any github account holder to display all their public github repositorys in a clean and cool way.

## Setup:
The setup is designed to be as easy as possible:

1. Open /assets/js/index.js and read the comments at the top of the file they will guide you through altering the variables for use with your account.
2. If you want your repo's card to have an image/cover photo go to the repo and add screenshot.png in a folder called assets on the main branch e.g. I want my repo named management_console to have a screenshot so I would go to https://github.com/futurelucas4502/management_console and create a folder called assets and add an image called screenshot.png.
3. Your done go view your awesome new website!
