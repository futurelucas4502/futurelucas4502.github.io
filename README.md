# futurelucas4502.github.io

## About:
This is a completely dynamic single page website which can be used by any github account holder to display all their public github repositorys, documentation and readme's in a clean and cool way!

All you need to do is follow the simple setup guide below.

## Setup:

[https://futurelucas4502.github.io/docs/index.html?docs=futurelucas4502.github.io](https://futurelucas4502.github.io/docs/index.html?docs=futurelucas4502.github.io)

## Example:

[https://futurelucas4502.github.io](https://futurelucas4502.github.io)

## Compatibility:

This project has been confirmed to run on both desktop and mobile in: chrome, safari, edge and firefox.

IE is obviously not supported and never will as it doesnt support async.

## Note:

When testing on localhost it may fail to load the buttons correctly but dont worry when you host it on github pages it will display them properly this is to do with how jekyll adds some styling tags and therefore something I cannot fix without adding a lot of code which isn't needed when it's online anyway
